# Personal Projects

This repository is part of the Personal Project series for Phase 2. This is 1 of the 3 Personal Projects for this phase. These projects are intentionally open ended but aim to cover all the Learning Competencies with your project. The instructors are available to answer any questions you have around these projects.

## Submission Process

1. Clone this repository.
2. Create a branch with your name.
3. Copy or create your starter code (Sinatra Skeleton or ASP.NET MVC) in the repository's root directory.
4. Commit and push up to origin.
5. Create a pull request.
6. Tag an instructor on your pull request for review or when you are done.

# API App

The goal of this Personal Project is to build an app that uses an API otherwise it is completely open. If you choose to have a back end then for Rubyists this means you will be basing your project off of the [Sinatra Skeleton](../../../sinatra-skeleton-mvc-challenge) and for Sharpies this will mean creating a new ASP.NET MVC app in Visual Studio.

### Learning Competencies

The things we will be looking to see if you have learned in this project are:
  - **Use a third-party API**
  - **Testing**

### User Stories

This project is completely open. All we ask is you interact with one or more [3rd party APIs](http://www.programmableweb.com/category/all/apis?order=field_popularity).

- Make your own user stories!
